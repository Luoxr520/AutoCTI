Example 1:

'CTI': Attackers are weaponizing an old Microsoft Office vulnerability as part of phishing campaigns to distribute a strain of malware called Agent Tesla. The infection chains leverage decoy Excel documents attached in invoice-themed messages to trick potential targets into opening them and activate the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 (CVSS score: 7.8), a memory corruption vulnerability in Office's Equation Editor that could result in code execution with the privileges of the user. The findings, which come from Zscaler ThreatLabz, build on prior reports from Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, which detailed a similar phishing campaign that exploited the security flaw to deliver the malware. Once a user downloads a malicious attachment and opens it, if their version of Microsoft Excel is vulnerable, the Excel file initiates communication with a malicious destination and proceeds to download additional files without requiring any further user interaction. The first payload is an obfuscated Visual Basic Script, which initiates the download of a malicious JPG file that comes embedded with a Base64-encoded DLL file.

Example 2:

'CTI': The Android banking malware known as Vultur has been updated with new capabilities, allowing operators to interact with the infected devices and modify files, according to a report from security consulting outfit NCC Group. Vultur was first documented in March 2021, when it stood out for the abuse of the legitimate applications AlphaVNC and ngrok for remotely accessing the VNC server on the victim device, and for automating screen recording and key-logging for credential harvesting. The most recent version of the banking malware, however, packs significantly more capabilities, allowing attackers to control the infected device, prevent applications from running, display custom notifications, bypass lock-screen protections, and download, upload, install, search for, and delete files. The infection chain starts with a SMS message instructing the victim to call a phone number to resolve a large transaction that they did not authorize. During the call, a second SMS message that includes a link to a modified McAfee Security package is received. The modified application contains the functionality of the legitimate McAfee Security software, along with the dropper-framework called Brunhilda, which deploys Vultur via three payloads, the last two designed to invoke each other\u2019s functionality. \u201cThe message sent by the malware operator through FCM can contain a command, which, upon receipt, triggers the execution of corresponding functionality within the malware. This eliminates the need for an ongoing connection with the device,\u201d NCC Group explains. The latest version of Vultur can also prevent the user from interacting with applications on the device, which are defined in a list provided by the attacker.

Example 3:

'CTI': The prolific North Korean state-backed threat actor known as TA444 is back with shiny new malware for targeting macOS users, dubbed \"SpectralBlur.\" The custom tool is the latest in a string of proprietary malware that the advanced persistent threat (APT) group has been consistently generating \u2014 a trait that sets it apart from other DPRK-sponsored threats.According to Proofpoint threat researcher Greg Lesnewich, TA444 (aka APT38, BlueNoroff, BlackAlicanto, Coperenicum, Sapphire Sleet, and Stardust Chollima) debuted the SpectralBlur malware in August. It's a \"moderately capable backdoor, that can upload/download files, run a shell, update its configuration, delete files, hibernate, or sleep, based on commands issued from the [command-and-control server],\"

Example 4:

'CTI': Sea Turtle, also known by the names Cosmic Wolf, Marbled Dust (formerly Silicon), Teal Kurma, and UNC1326, was first documented by Cisco Talos in April 2019, detailing state-sponsored attacks targeting public and private entities in the Middle East and North Africa. Activities associated with the group are believed to have been ongoing since January 2017, primarily leveraging DNS hijacking to redirect prospective targets attempting to query a specific domain to an actor-controlled server capable of harvesting their credentials. Then last month, the adversary was revealed to be using a simple reverse TCP shell for Linux (and Unix) systems called SnappyTCP in attacks carried out between 2021 and 2023, according to the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Threat Intelligence team. The web shell is a simple reverse TCP shell for Linux/Unix that has basic [command-and-control] capabilities, and is also likely used for establishing persistence

Target report:

\"CTI\": While reverse engineering Tesla's power improvements, a researcher discovered that the battery management system (BMS) defined the drive unit's power limit. The researcher used CAN messages, UDS messages, firmware files, and decrypted diagnostic messages to reverse engineer the upgrade process. He discovered which hardware changes were required in the BMS to execute the power improvement upgrade and performed them on a P85D. Later, he modified the firmware of the BMS and the relevant files on the security gateway to accept the modified battery pack. He bricked the car during the firmware update process and had to troubleshoot it.

Example 1:

'CTI': Over 5,300 internet-exposed GitLab instances are vulnerable to CVE-2023-7028, a zero-click account takeover flaw GitLab warned about earlier this month. The critical (CVSS score: 10.0) flaw allows attackers to send password reset emails for a targeted account to an attacker-controlled email address, allowing the threat actor to change the password and take over the account. Based on GitLab's role as a software development and project planning platform and the type and severity of the flaw, these servers are at risk of supply chain attacks, proprietary code disclosure, API key leaks, and other malicious activity.

Example 2:

'CTI': A new zero-day security flaw has been discovered in Apache OfBiz, an open-source Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that could be exploited to bypass authentication protections.The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-51467, resides in the login functionality and is the result of an incomplete patch for another critical vulnerability (CVE-2023-49070, CVSS score: 9.8) that was released earlier this month. CVE-2023-49070 refers to a pre-authenticated remote code execution flaw impacting versions prior to 18.12.10 that, when successfully exploited, could allow threat actors to gain full control over the server and siphon sensitive data. It is caused due to a deprecated XML-RPC component within Apache OFBiz. CVE-2023-51467 could be triggered using empty and invalid USERNAME and PASSWORD parameters in an HTTP request to return an authentication success message, effectively circumventing the protection and enabling a threat actor to access otherwise unauthorized internal resources.

Example 3:

'CTI': Star Blizzard (aka Seaborgium, BlueCharlie, Callisto Group, and Coldriver) has been carrying out email credential theft in service of cyberespionage and cyber influence campaigns since at least 2017. Historically, it has focused its aim on public and private organizations in NATO member countries, typically in fields related to politics, defense, and related sectors \u2014 NGOs, think tanks, journalists, academic institutions, intergovernmental organizations, and so on. In recent years, it has especially targeted individuals and organizations providing support for Ukraine. To aid in sneaking past email filters, Star Blizzard has started using password-protected PDF lure documents, or links to cloud-based file sharing platforms with the protected PDFs contained within. The passwords to these documents typically come packaged in the same phishing email, or an email sent shortly after the first.

Example 4:

'CTI': Microsoft security researchers recently identified a campaign where attackers attempted to move laterally to a cloud environment through a SQL Server instance. This attack technique demonstrates an approach we've seen in other cloud services such as VMs and Kubernetes cluster, but not in SQL Server. The attackers initially exploited a SQL injection vulnerability in an application within the target's environment. This allowed the attacker to gain access and elevated permissions on a Microsoft SQL Server instance deployed in Azure Virtual Machine (VM). The attackers then used the acquired elevated permission to attempt to move laterally to additional cloud resources by abusing the server's cloud identity. Cloud identities are commonly used in cloud services including SQL Server and may possess elevated permissions to carry out actions in the cloud. This attack highlights the need to properly secure cloud identities to defend SQL Server instances and cloud resources from unauthorized access.

Target report:

\"CTI\": A hacker published the full content of a GitLab server containing detailed information on a Mercedes OLU component, which simplifies access and management of live vehicle data. The server contained all of the 580 repositories related to the OLU, including images, code, detailed documentation, and development environments. The researcher was able to access the server by registering with a non-existent Daimler corporate email and decided to share the information on multiple file sharing sites. Another researcher claims he discovered passwords and API tokens for Daimler's internal systems in the repository. If attained by the wrong hands, these passwords and access tokens could be used to plan and mount future intrusions against Daimler's cloud and internal network.

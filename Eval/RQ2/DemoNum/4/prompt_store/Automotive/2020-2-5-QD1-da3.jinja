Example 1:

'CTI': United States organizations within the financial sector are currently being attacked by a recently discovered ransomware operation named, Yanluowang. The ransomware operation is highly experienced with ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) and could be linked to veteran RaaS groups, Fivehands and Thieflock. Although the group is primarily focused on attacking organizations within the financial sector, they have also targeted companies in manufacturing, IT services, consultancy, and engineering. Let's take a look at Yanluowang's techniques, tactics, and how they may be connected to Fivehands and Thieflock. In October 2021, Symantec's Threat Hunter Team, a division of Broadcom Software, discovered that Yanluowang ransomware was actively being used by a threat actor who was seen attacking U.S. corporations since at least August 2021. What was interesting about the attack was that many of the tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) used were previously used by ransomware threat actor, Thieflock. Most analysts assumed that the threat actor using Yanluowang must be an affiliate of Thieflock who shifted allegiances. Although Yanluowang attempted to attack a large organization in October 2021 by deploying ransomware, they were not successful due to the ransomware being somewhat underdeveloped. According to Symantec, their Threat Hunter Team initially discovered the use of AdFind, a legitimate command-line Active Directory query tool, on the undisclosed target's network. Ransomware attackers often use AdFind as a reconnaissance tool. The tool also equipped attackers with resources that they needed for lateral movement by way of Active Directory. Days after discovering the suspicious use of AdFind, attackers attempted to deploy Yanluowang ransomware.

Example 2:

'CTI': After emerging in January 2022, Royal ransomware is a ransomware strain that is being distributed by ransomware threat actors from previous operations. Initially, Microsoft attributed the distribution of Royal ransomware to DEV-0569 - a temporary name given by the tech company. Now, researchers are stating that the threat actors behind Royal ransomware have officially branded themselves with the name Royal (the name left behind in recent ransomware notes) and they are primarily focused on targeting entities within the U.S. The ransomware operation uses unusual techniques to breach networks before encrypting them with malware and demanding ransom payments. Some Royal ransomware campaigns distribute the malware via malicious attachments, and some distribute the malware via malicious advertisements. Although Royal is a newer ransomware operation, researchers believe the threat actors behind it are very experienced due to evidence of previously seen tactics and techniques. In September 2022, the operators behind Royal ransomware began ramping up their malicious activities. They were observed by our technology partner, AdvIntel, utilizing other ransomware operation's encryptors, such as BlackCat. By November 2022, Royal took responsibility for a ransomware attack on one of the United Kingdom's most popular racing circuits - Silverstone Circuit. The attack held up dozens of Formula One races and motorcycle events. Details regarding the attack were not disclosed, but Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow stated that because Royal's ransomware is secure, its encryption cannot be broken. Callow also stated that unlike current ransomware groups, Royal uses multiple ransomware types and uses the .Royal extension for encrypted files rather than using randomly generated extensions.

Example 3:

'CTI': Microsoft warned Friday night that some of its corporate email accounts were breached and data stolen by a Russian state-sponsored hacking group known as Midnight Blizzard. The company detected the attack on January 12th, with Microsoft's investigation ultimately determining that the attack was conducted by Russian threat actors known more commonly as Nobelium or APT29. Microsoft says the threat actors breached their systems in November 2023 when they conducted a password spray attack to access a legacy non-production test tenant account. Microsoft says the breached email accounts included members of Microsoft's leadership team and employees in the cybersecurity and legal departments, from which the hackers stole emails and attachments.

Example 4:

'CTI': More threat actors have started exploiting two recently resolved vulnerabilities in the ConnectWise ScreenConnect remote desktop access software. The issues, tracked as CVE-2024-1709 (CVSS score of 10) and CVE-2024-1708 (CVSS score of 8.4), are described as an authentication bypass flaw and a path traversal bug. ConnectWise disclosed the security defects on February 19, when it announced patches for them. Two days later, the company updated its advisory to warn of ongoing exploitation. \u201cEssentially, a bad actor could mimic the role as system admin, delete all other users and take over the instance,\u201d the company notes in its advisory. A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit targeting the flaws, collectively referred to as SlashAndGrab, was made public last week, and threat actors quickly started exploiting them for malware delivery. Now, Trend Micro says that more cybercrime groups have started exploiting the flaws, including the Black Basta and Bl00dy ransomware groups. Following initial access to vulnerable servers, Black Basta was seen performing reconnaissance, discovery, and elevation of privilege activities, and deploying Cobalt Strike payloads. In addition to searching for members of the \u2018domain admin\u2019 group, the attackers also added new accounts to the administrator group and deployed scripts to identify machines that recently connected to the Active Directory environment.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Toll Group, an Australian transportation company, was struck by a targeted ransomware attack leading the company to disable their systems as a precautionary measure. The shutdown impacted several of its customer-facing applications and created a delay in the company's operations, forcing the company to return to manual processing. The ransomware is believed to have infected as many as 1,000 servers, including Active Directory and corporate VPN, affecting the company's 40,000 employees.

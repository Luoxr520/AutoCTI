Example 1:

'CTI': North Korean APT Lazarus is up to its old tricks with a cyberespionage campaign targeting engineers with a fake job posting that attempt to spread macOS malware. The malicious Mac executable used in the campaign targets both Apple and Intel chip-based systems. The campaign, identified by researchers from ESET Research Labs and revealed in a series of tweets posted Tuesday, impersonates cryptocurrency trader Coinbase in a job description claiming to seek an engineering manager for product security, researchers divulged. Dubbed Operation Interception, the recent campaign drops a signed Mac executable disguised as a job description for Coinbase, which researchers discovered uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil. Malware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon. It drops three files: a decoy PDF document Coinbase_online_careers_2022_07.pdf, a bundle http[://]FinderFontsUpdater[.]app and a downloader safarifontagent.\u201d

Example 2:

'CTI': GitHub rotated keys potentially exposed by a vulnerability patched in December that could let attackers access credentials within production containers via environment variables. This unsafe reflection vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2024-0200) can allow attackers to gain remote code execution on unpatched servers. GitHub also fixed a second high-severity Enterprise Server command injection vulnerability (CVE-2024-0507) that would allow attackers using a Management Console user account with an editor role to escalate privileges.

Example 3:

'CTI': A new vulnerability, which we refer to as \u201cMigraine\u201d for its involvement with macOS migration, could allow an attacker with root access to automatically bypass System Integrity Protection (SIP) in macOS and perform arbitrary operations on a device. We shared these findings with Apple through Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) via Microsoft Security Vulnerability Research (MSVR). A fix for this vulnerability, now identified as CVE-2023-32369, was included in the security updates released by Apple on May 18, 2023.

Example 4:

'CTI': The notorious North Korean threat group known as Lazarus exploited a Windows zero-day vulnerability for privilege escalation in attacks involving a rootkit named FudModule, according to cybersecurity firm Avast. The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2024-21338 and it was observed by Avast in Lazarus attacks last year. The security company developed a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit and sent it to Microsoft in August 2023. The flaw was patched by Microsoft with the company\u2019s February 2024 Patch Tuesday updates, but the initial advisory for CVE-2024-21338 did not list it as a zero-day. The vulnerability impacts the \u2018appid.sys\u2019 driver associated with Microsoft\u2019s AppLocker security feature. By targeting a vulnerability in a driver that is present on many systems \u2014 rather than using a bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD) approach \u2014 the attacker benefits from a higher degree of stealth. \u201cBy exploiting such a vulnerability, the attacker is in a sense living off the land with no need to bring, drop, or load any custom drivers, making it possible for a kernel attack to be truly fileless. This not only evades most detection mechanisms but also enables the attack on systems where driver allowlisting is in place,\u201d Avast explained. By exploiting CVE-2024-21338, Lazarus hackers were able to elevate their privileges on the compromised system and establish a kernel read/write primitive. This enabled them to perform direct kernel object manipulation in an updated version of the FudModule rootkit, which came to light in 2022.

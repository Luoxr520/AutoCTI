Example 1:

'CTI': In May 2023, Kroll Cyber Threat Intelligence analysts published their discoveries of a new ransomware variant referred to as CACTUS, which has been actively targeting large commercial entities since March 2023. The name CACTUS is derived from the filename found within the ransom note, cAcTuS.readme.txt, and is also self-declared within the note. Encrypted files carry the extension .cts1, although variations in the appended number have been observed across different incidents and victims. CACTUS uses a unique tactic by requiring a key for decrypting the binary, likely implemented to evade antivirus detection. This key is embedded within a file named ntuser.dat, loaded through a scheduled task. Kroll's research noted instances of data exfiltration and victim extortion over Tox, a peer-to-peer messaging service, but no known victim leak site was identified.In its operations, CACTUS demonstrates a consistent set of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The initial exploit involves the exploitation of vulnerable VPN appliances, a prevalent method observed across multiple CACTUS incidents. Once inside the network, the threat actor conducts internal scouting using tools like SoftPerfect Network Scanner and PowerShell commands to enumerate endpoints, identify user accounts, and ping remote endpoints. To maintain persistence, CACTUS deploys various remote access methods, including legitimate tools like Splashtop, AnyDesk, and SuperOps RMM, along with malicious tools like Cobalt Strike and Chisel. The threat actor attempts to disable security software using custom scripts, such as TotalExec, and uninstall common antivirus software.

Example 2:

'CTI': We have discovered an advanced persistent threat (APT) group that primarily targets online gambling sites. This group, which we have dubbed Earth Berberoka (aka GamblingPuppet), uses old yet upgraded malware families that have been attributed to Chinese-speaking actors, including PlugX and Gh0st RAT. It also uses a brand-new multistage malware family, which we have dubbed PuppetLoader. The malware families used by Earth Berberoka are multiplatform, targeting the Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.

Example 3:

'CTI': Crysis/Dharma ransomware (detected by Trend Micro as Ransom.Win32.CRYSIS.TIBGGS) has released a hacking toolkit named Toolbox, Sophos reports. Toolbox contains Mimikatz to harvest passwords, NirSoft Remote Desktop PassView to steal remote desktop protocol (RDP) passwords, Hash Suite Tools Free to dump hashes, and other tools to help find target computers and deploy the ransomware payload. With this kit, even rookie hackers can infiltrate networks easily. Crysis operates under a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, and this hacking tool only makes it easier for affiliates to spread the ransomware to more targets.

Example 4:

'CTI': GitHub rotated keys potentially exposed by a vulnerability patched in December that could let attackers access credentials within production containers via environment variables. This unsafe reflection vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2024-0200) can allow attackers to gain remote code execution on unpatched servers. GitHub also fixed a second high-severity Enterprise Server command injection vulnerability (CVE-2024-0507) that would allow attackers using a Management Console user account with an editor role to escalate privileges.

Target report:

\"CTI\": An Indian gang used sophisticated tools including a chip-reader and a hacking system, which included software available online, to steal more than 200 vehicles. The thieves procured different keys online and transferred the vehicles' sensor coding to those keys, effectively duplicating the real key.

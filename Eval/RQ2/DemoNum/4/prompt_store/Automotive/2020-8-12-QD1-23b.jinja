Example 1:

'CTI': Threat actors are using public exploits to pummel a critical zero-day remote code execution (RCE) flaw that affects all versions of a popular collaboration tool used in cloud and hybrid server environments and allows for complete host takeover.Researchers from Volexity uncovered the flaw in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center software over the Memorial Day weekend after they detected suspicious activity on two internet-facing web servers belonging to a customer running the software, they said in a blog post published last week. The researchers tracked the activity to a public exploit for the vulnerability, CVE-2022-26134, that\u2019s been spreading rapidly, and subsequently reported the flaw to Atlassian. As observed by Volexity researchers, what\u2019s being described as an \u201cOGNL injection vulnerability\u201d appears to allow for a Java Server Page (JSP) webshell to be written into a publicly accessible web directory on Confluence software.

Example 2:

'CTI': A Windows 11 vulnerability, part of Microsoft\u2019s Patch Tuesday roundup of fixes, is being exploited in the wild, prompting the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to advise patching of the elevation of privileges flaw by August 2. The recommendation is directed at federal agencies and concerns CVE-2022-22047, a vulnerability that carries a CVSS score of high (7.8) and exposes Windows Client Server Runtime Subsystem (CSRSS) used in Windows 11 (and earlier versions dating back to 7) and also Windows Server 2022 (and earlier versions 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2019) to attack. The CSRSS bug is an elevation of privileges vulnerability that allows adversaries with a pre-established foothold on a targeted system to execute code as an unprivileged user. When the bug was first reported by Microsoft\u2019s own security team earlier this month it was classified as a zero-day, or a known bug with no patch.

Example 3:

'CTI': Graphican is an evolution of the known Flea backdoor Ketrican, which itself was based on a previous malware \u2014 BS2005 \u2014 also used by Flea. Graphican has the same basic functionality as Ketrican, with the difference between them being Graphican's use of the Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive to obtain its command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure. This technique was used in a similar way by the Russian state-sponsored APT group Swallowtail (aka APT28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Strontium) in a campaign in 2022 in which it delivered the Graphite malware. In that campaign, the Graphite malware used the Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive as a C&C server. The observed Graphican samples did not have a hardcoded C&C server, rather they connected to OneDrive via the Microsoft Graph API to get the encrypted C&C server address from a child folder inside the Person folder. The malware then decoded the folder name and used it as a C&C server for the malware. All instances of this variant used the same parameters to authenticate to the Microsoft Graph API.

Example 4:

'CTI': Attackers are exploiting a 6-year-old Microsoft Office remote code execution (RCE) flaw to deliver spyware, in an email campaign weaponized by malicious Excel attachments and characterized by sophisticated evasion tactics. Threat actors dangle lures relating to business activity in spam emails that deliver files that contain CVE-2017-11882, an RCE flaw that dates back to 2014 and can allow for system takeover, Zscaler revealed in a blog post published Dec. 19. The end goal of the attack is to load Agent Tesla, a remote access Trojan (RAT) and advanced keylogger first discovered in 2014, and exfiltrate credentials and other data from an infected system via a Telegram bot run by the attackers.

Target report:

\"CTI\": A hacker exploited a vulnerability discovered in Tesla's server-side mechanism to access Tesla's network and view a repository of server images. One of the servers accessed, named \u2018Mothership', was the Command-and-Control server used to communicate with Tesla's customer fleet; Any kind of remote commands or diagnostic information from the car to Tesla goes through this server. By reverse-engineering his car\u2019s VPN connection to contact Mothership, the hacker landed on a developer network connection. He found a critical bug in Mothership itself that enabled him to authenticate as any Tesla vehicle in the world. The vulnerability allowed him to control and get information about any car in the fleet and send commands to those cars.

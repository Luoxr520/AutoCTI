Example 1:

'CTI': Threat actors are exploiting a critical vulnerability in Magento to inject a persistent backdoor into ecommerce websites, cybersecurity firm Sansec reports. The issue, tracked as CVE-2024-20720 (CVSS score of 9.1), is described as an OS command injection flaw leading to arbitrary code execution without user interaction. Adobe resolved the critical vulnerability in February 2024 in both Adobe Commerce and Magento, as part of its Tuesday Patch updates. However, it appears that there are websites that have yet to be updated and remain vulnerable to exploitation. According to Sansec, threat actors have discovered a clever way to exploit CVE-2024-20720, using a crafted layout template in the database to inject XML code that can reinfect Magento servers even after a manual fix. Attackers combine the Magento layout parser with the beberlei/assert package (installed by default) to execute system commands. Because the layout block is tied to the checkout cart, this command is executed whenever <store>/checkout/cart is requested. As part of the observed attacks, the backdoor is added to the automatically generated content management system (CMS) controller, ensuring the backdoor is periodically reinjected and providing persistent remote code execution via POST commands. The threat actors have employed the mechanism to inject a fake Stripe payment skimmer and steal payment data from the compromised web stores.

Example 2:

'CTI': Apple released security updates to address this year's first zero-day vulnerability exploited in attacks that could impact iPhones, Macs, and Apple TVs. The zero-day fixed today is tracked as CVE-2024-23222 and is a WebKit confusion issue that attackers could exploit to gain code execution on targeted devices. Successful exploitation enables threat actors to execute arbitrary malicious code on devices running vulnerable iOS, macOS, and tvOS versions after opening a malicious web page.

Example 3:

'CTI': Sea Turtle, also known by the names Cosmic Wolf, Marbled Dust (formerly Silicon), Teal Kurma, and UNC1326, was first documented by Cisco Talos in April 2019, detailing state-sponsored attacks targeting public and private entities in the Middle East and North Africa. Activities associated with the group are believed to have been ongoing since January 2017, primarily leveraging DNS hijacking to redirect prospective targets attempting to query a specific domain to an actor-controlled server capable of harvesting their credentials. Then last month, the adversary was revealed to be using a simple reverse TCP shell for Linux (and Unix) systems called SnappyTCP in attacks carried out between 2021 and 2023, according to the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Threat Intelligence team. The web shell is a simple reverse TCP shell for Linux/Unix that has basic [command-and-control] capabilities, and is also likely used for establishing persistence

Example 4:

'CTI': Security researchers are documenting a new vulnerability found in the util-linux core utilities package in Linux systems, warnign that it allows attackers to leak user passwords and modify the clipboard. The security defect, tracked as CVE-2024-28085 and dubbed \u2018WallEscape\u2019, impacts the \u2018wall\u2019 command of util-linux that fails to filter escape sequences from command line arguments. An attacker could embed escape sequences into crafted messages and send them via the \u2018wall\u2019 command, allowing them to leak passwords and modify commands, if specific conditions are met. \u201cThis allows unprivileged users to put arbitrary text on other users\u2019 terminals, if mesg is set to y and wall is setgid,\u201d said security researcher Skyler Ferrante.Ferrante, who is credited with discovering the flaw, said the bug can be exploited to leak user passwords on Ubuntu 22.04 with default configurations, where \u2018wall\u2019 is installed with the special setgid permissions and mesg is set to y. Debian Bookworm is also affected, but CentOS and Red Hat products are not. According to Ferrante, the flaw can also leak an unknown command on Ubuntu 22.0 \u201cif a system runs a command when commands are not found, with the unknown command as an argument.\u201d In addition, it can be exploited to change the output of any command.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Researchers reverse engineered the Android head unit system of KIA Cee'd, exploited the vehicle's ability to install third-party applications, and instead installed an app containing malware. They exploited a previously discovered root privilege escalation vulnerability and created an exploit that could inject CAN frames to the M-bus and modify some of the IVI functionalities, such as manipulating the radio volume, switch the infotainment on and off, activate the reverse camera, and set a navigation address.

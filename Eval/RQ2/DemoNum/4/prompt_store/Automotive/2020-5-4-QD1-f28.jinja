Example 1:

'CTI': Security researchers are documenting a new vulnerability found in the util-linux core utilities package in Linux systems, warnign that it allows attackers to leak user passwords and modify the clipboard. The security defect, tracked as CVE-2024-28085 and dubbed \u2018WallEscape\u2019, impacts the \u2018wall\u2019 command of util-linux that fails to filter escape sequences from command line arguments. An attacker could embed escape sequences into crafted messages and send them via the \u2018wall\u2019 command, allowing them to leak passwords and modify commands, if specific conditions are met. \u201cThis allows unprivileged users to put arbitrary text on other users\u2019 terminals, if mesg is set to y and wall is setgid,\u201d said security researcher Skyler Ferrante.Ferrante, who is credited with discovering the flaw, said the bug can be exploited to leak user passwords on Ubuntu 22.04 with default configurations, where \u2018wall\u2019 is installed with the special setgid permissions and mesg is set to y. Debian Bookworm is also affected, but CentOS and Red Hat products are not. According to Ferrante, the flaw can also leak an unknown command on Ubuntu 22.0 \u201cif a system runs a command when commands are not found, with the unknown command as an argument.\u201d In addition, it can be exploited to change the output of any command.

Example 2:

'CTI': Attackers are exploiting a 6-year-old Microsoft Office remote code execution (RCE) flaw to deliver spyware, in an email campaign weaponized by malicious Excel attachments and characterized by sophisticated evasion tactics. Threat actors dangle lures relating to business activity in spam emails that deliver files that contain CVE-2017-11882, an RCE flaw that dates back to 2014 and can allow for system takeover, Zscaler revealed in a blog post published Dec. 19. The end goal of the attack is to load Agent Tesla, a remote access Trojan (RAT) and advanced keylogger first discovered in 2014, and exfiltrate credentials and other data from an infected system via a Telegram bot run by the attackers.

Example 3:

'CTI': Log4j has been making headlines recently after the public disclosure of three critical vulnerabilities in the utility which can lead to remote code execution (CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046) and denial of service (CVE-2021-45105). The initial remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) has been dubbed Log4Shell and has dominated cyber-security news ever since it was publicly disclosed on December 9. The vulnerability has been exploited to deploy a plethora of payloads like coin miners, Dridex malware, and even ransomware such as Conti.

Example 4:

'CTI': As part of TAG's mission to counter serious threats to Google and our users, we've analyzed a range of persistent threats including APT35 and Charming Kitten, an Iranian government-backed group that regularly targets high risk users. For years, we have been countering this group\u2019s efforts to hijack accounts, deploy malware, and their use of novel techniques to conduct espionage aligned with the interests of the Iranian government. Now, we\u2019re shining light on a new tool of theirs. In December 2021, TAG discovered a novel Charming Kitten tool, named HYPERSCRAPE, used to steal user data from Gmail, Yahoo!, and Microsoft Outlook accounts. The attacker runs HYPERSCRAPE on their own machine to download victims\u2019 inboxes using previously acquired credentials. We have seen it deployed against fewer than two dozen accounts located in Iran. The oldest known sample is from 2020, and the tool is still under active development. We have taken actions to re-secure these accounts and have notified the victims through our Government Backed Attacker Warnings.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Security experts have discovered old Tesla car parts for sale on eBay that still contained user data belonging to the previous owner, in a sign that the firm\u2019s retrofitting service is failing customers on privacy. Some of the resold infotainment contents were phone books, hundreds of call log entries, calendar entries, home, and work locations. The units were loaded with Gmail accounts, YouTube, and Netflix session cookies. The researcher also discovered readable Wi-Fi and Spotify passwords.

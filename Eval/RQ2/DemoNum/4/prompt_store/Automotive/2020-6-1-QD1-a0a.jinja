Example 1:

'CTI': The latest zero-day, which Google is tracking as CVE-2023-6345, stems from an integer overflow issue in Skia, an open source 2D graphic library in Chrome. The bug is one of seven Chrome vulnerabilities for which Google issued a security update this week. The company's advisory contained sparse details on CVE-2023-6345 beyond mentioning the fact that an exploit for it is publicly available. A brief description on NIST's National Vulnerability Database (NVD) site described the flaw as affecting versions of Chrome prior to 119.0.6045.199 and allowing a remote attacker who has compromised the renderer process to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a malicious file.

Example 2:

'CTI': Fancy Bear, also known as APT 28, Sofacy, or Swallowtail, is a cyberespionage group that is linked to the Russian government. The group has been in operation since 2008, targeting the energy, government, media, aerospace, and defense sectors via phishing campaigns and credential harvesting. Fancy Bear is known to target both computers and mobile devices, running multiple intrusion operations concurrently. In 2016, Fancy Bear was front and center after they attacked the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The group was also responsible for leaking confidential drug testing information after they attacked the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) during the same year. Fancy Bear took credit for the attack and leaked the stolen information on a site named Fancy Bears. Despite two very public attacks, Fancy Bear returned to the shadows in 2017. Since that time, the group's activities have become clandestine, motivated by intelligence gathering. Between 2017 and 2018, Fancy Bear targeted the following organizations: European military, European government, A South American country's government, An Eastern European embassy, A prominent international organization. After much attention, Fancy Bear became more discreet, and not much was heard from the APT until their recent attacks on Ukrainians. In July 2022, researchers from Malwarebytes observed malicious activity from the group. They were sending malicious documents that contained an exploit for the Microsoft zero-day, Follina (CVE-2022-30190).

Example 3:

'CTI': We found Operation Earth Kitsune using a total of five C&C servers, seven samples, and four new bugs, aiming to compromise websites to host malware. We initiated our investigation after noticing that the Korean American National Coordinating Council (KANCC) website was redirecting visitors to the Hanseattle website. Users who accessed the said site were redirected to a weaponized version of a proof of concept (POC) for the CVE-2019-5782 Google Chrome vulnerability published in the chromium tracking system. Digging deeper, we discovered that the attack does not only involve a weaponized version of the mentioned Chrome exploit; the exploit was infecting the victim machine with three separate malware samples.

Example 4:

'CTI': In an interview in January 2023, threat actors behind TargetCompany clarified that each major update of the ransomware entailed a change in the encryption algorithm and different decryptor characteristics. These are accompanied by a change in file name extensions, hence the evolution of names by which the ransomware group is known. We will discuss this evolution further in our blog entry. TargetCompany's earlier variants provided a \u201c.onion\u201d contact site for negotiations and dropped ransom notes named How to decrypt files.txt. Meanwhile, later variants of the TargetCompany ransomware no longer use the name of the targeted enterprise as file name extensions. In mid- to late 2022, the group was given the name\u202fFargo due to the extension that it added to its encrypted files in that period. Other extensions used by the ransomware group include \u201c.mallox,\u201d and \u201c.xollam.\u201d These later variants were observed using a combination of Chacha20, Curve 25519, and AES-128 algorithms to encrypt the victim's files. The ransomware group eventually established a data leak site under the name Mallox, and later variants dropped ransom notes as HOW TO RECOVER!!.txt.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Hackers attacked the website of the UzAuto automaker (formerly known as GM Uzbekistan). The attack caused a temporary malfunction of the site, but due to the efforts of the company's IT experts, not a single file or page on the site were damaged, and the site resumed operations after a short period of time.

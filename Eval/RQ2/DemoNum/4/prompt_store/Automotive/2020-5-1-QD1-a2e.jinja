Example 1:

'CTI': In January 2021, Threat Analysis Group (TAG) publicly disclosed a campaign from government backed actors in North Korea who used 0-day exploits to target security researchers working on vulnerability research and development. Over the past two and a half years, TAG has continued to track and disrupt campaigns from these actors, finding 0-days and protecting online users. Recently, TAG became aware of a new campaign likely from the same actors based on similarities with the previous campaign.

Example 2:

'CTI': Microsoft Threat Intelligence has uncovered a supply chain attack by the North Korea-based threat actor Diamond Sleet (ZINC) involving a malicious variant of an application developed by CyberLink Corp., a software company that develops multimedia software products. This malicious file is a legitimate CyberLink application installer that has been modified to include malicious code that downloads, decrypts, and loads a second-stage payload. The file, which was signed using a valid certificate issued to CyberLink Corp., is hosted on legitimate update infrastructure owned by CyberLink and includes checks to limit the time window for execution and evade detection by security products. Thus far, the malicious activity has impacted over 100 devices in multiple countries, including Japan, Taiwan, Canada, and the United States.

Example 3:

'CTI': Last week Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), in partnership with The Citizen Lab, discovered an in-the-wild 0-day exploit chain for iPhones. Developed by the commercial surveillance vendor, Intellexa, this exploit chain is used to install its Predator spyware surreptitiously onto a device. In response, yesterday, Apple patched the bugs in iOS 16.7 and iOS 17.0.1 as CVE-2023-41991, CVE-2023-41992, CVE-2023-41993. This quick patching from Apple helps to better protect users and we encourage all iOS users to install them as soon as possible.

Example 4:

'CTI': Unit 42 recently discovered a malware campaign targeting Portuguese speakers, which aims to redirect cryptocurrency away from legitimate users\u2019 wallets and into wallets controlled by threat actors instead. To do this, the campaign uses a type of malware known as a cryptocurrency clipper, which monitors the victim\u2019s clipboard for signs that a cryptocurrency wallet address is being copied. The malware, which we call CryptoClippy, seeks to replace the user\u2019s actual wallet address with the threat actor\u2019s, causing the user to inadvertently send cryptocurrency to the threat actor. Unit 42 Managed Threat Hunting found victims across manufacturing, IT services, and real estate industries, though they likely impacted the personal wallet addresses of someone using their work machine. To deliver the malware to users\u2019 computers, threat actors in this campaign used both Google Ads and traffic distribution systems (TDS) to redirect victims to malicious domains that are impersonating the legitimate WhatsApp Web application. They use this to ensure victims are real users, and also that they\u2019re Portuguese speakers. For users who are sent to malicious domains, the threat attempts to trick them into downloading malicious files, including either .zip or .exe files, that lead to the final payload.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Visitors to several infected sites, including a store selling auto parts, were victims of a phishing campaign informing them that their security certificate has expired. The campaign overlayed the website's content with a legitimate-looking banner prompting the users to install an updated certificate claiming that their certificate has expired. By clicking install, users downloaded malware directly to their computer.

Example 1:

'CTI': GitHub rotated keys potentially exposed by a vulnerability patched in December that could let attackers access credentials within production containers via environment variables. This unsafe reflection vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2024-0200) can allow attackers to gain remote code execution on unpatched servers. GitHub also fixed a second high-severity Enterprise Server command injection vulnerability (CVE-2024-0507) that would allow attackers using a Management Console user account with an editor role to escalate privileges.

Example 2:

'CTI': Attackers are exploiting a 6-year-old Microsoft Office remote code execution (RCE) flaw to deliver spyware, in an email campaign weaponized by malicious Excel attachments and characterized by sophisticated evasion tactics. Threat actors dangle lures relating to business activity in spam emails that deliver files that contain CVE-2017-11882, an RCE flaw that dates back to 2014 and can allow for system takeover, Zscaler revealed in a blog post published Dec. 19. The end goal of the attack is to load Agent Tesla, a remote access Trojan (RAT) and advanced keylogger first discovered in 2014, and exfiltrate credentials and other data from an infected system via a Telegram bot run by the attackers.

Example 3:

'CTI': CVE-2023-36884 is a remote code execution vulnerability that was previously patched. The vulnerability allowed attackers to craft Microsoft Office documents in a way that circumvented the Mark of the Web (MoTW) security feature. This allowed the files to be opened without triggering a security warning, ultimately enabling remote code execution. To counteract a previously mitigated but actively exploited CVE-2023-36884 flaw, Microsoft has introduced an Office Defense in Depth update. The Russian threat actor Storm-0978/RomCom is responsible for actively exploiting this vulnerability. This group, previously recognized for deploying the Industrial Spy ransomware in their attacks, has now rebranded as 'Underground' and extorts victims through their ransomware operations.

Example 4:

'CTI': ChromeLoader may seem on the surface like a run-of-the-mill browser hijacker that merely redirects victims to advertisement websites. However, its use of PowerShell could pose a greater risk by leading to further and advanced malicious activity, such as the propagation of ransomware or spyware or theft of browser-session data. Researchers are warning of the potential for ChromeLoader-which has seen a resurgence in activity recently-to pose a more sophisticated threat than typical malvertisers do, according to two separate blog posts by Malwarebytes Labs and Red Canary. ChromeLoader is a pervasive and persistent browser hijacker that eventually manifests as a browser extension, modifying victims\u2019 Chrome settings and redirecting user traffic to advertisement websites. On Windows machines, victims become infected with the malware through ISO files that poses as a cracked video game or pirated films or TV programs.

Target report:

\"CTI\": A researcher discovered a vulnerability in Tesla model 3 browser which allowed hackers to deny some of the services in the vehicle's driving interface. By routing the vehicle\u2019s browser traffic to a malicious website, attackers would be able to disable the speedometer, web browser, climate controls, turn signals, navigation, autopilot notifications, and blinker notifications along with other functions from the main screen. The vulnerability was due to improper process separation in Tesla model 3.

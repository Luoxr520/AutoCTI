Example 1:

'CTI': Clop is an extortion and ransomware operation run by a cyber-crime group known as Snakefly (aka TA505, FIN11). While the group initially extorted victims by encrypting files using its own ransomware payload (Ransom.Clop), in recent times it has been known to eschew encryption entirely and rely on the threat of leaking stolen data to extort its victims. The group has a track record in exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. In 2021, it was linked to the exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities in Accellion FTA, another file-transfer application. Earlier this year it was responsible for exploiting a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2023-0669) in the GoAnywhere MFT platform.

Example 2:

'CTI': Unit 42 recently discovered a malware campaign targeting Portuguese speakers, which aims to redirect cryptocurrency away from legitimate users\u2019 wallets and into wallets controlled by threat actors instead. To do this, the campaign uses a type of malware known as a cryptocurrency clipper, which monitors the victim\u2019s clipboard for signs that a cryptocurrency wallet address is being copied. The malware, which we call CryptoClippy, seeks to replace the user\u2019s actual wallet address with the threat actor\u2019s, causing the user to inadvertently send cryptocurrency to the threat actor. Unit 42 Managed Threat Hunting found victims across manufacturing, IT services, and real estate industries, though they likely impacted the personal wallet addresses of someone using their work machine. To deliver the malware to users\u2019 computers, threat actors in this campaign used both Google Ads and traffic distribution systems (TDS) to redirect victims to malicious domains that are impersonating the legitimate WhatsApp Web application. They use this to ensure victims are real users, and also that they\u2019re Portuguese speakers. For users who are sent to malicious domains, the threat attempts to trick them into downloading malicious files, including either .zip or .exe files, that lead to the final payload.

Example 3:

'CTI': RansomExx is a ransomware variant that debuted as Defray777 in 2018. It made a name for itself in 2020, after it was used in widely reported attacks on government agencies, manufacturers, and other such high-profile only months apart. By then, it was dubbed RansomEXX after the string \u201cransom.exx\u201d was found in its binary. In 2020, the group also started a leak site for publishing stolen data.Today, RansomEXX remains an active name among other ransomware variants like LockBit and Conti. Like other groups, the one running RansomEXX appears to have no qualms about publishing data stolen from its targets. It has also published information stolen from government agencies \u2014 a recent case was an attack on a Scottish mental health charity in March 2022, where they published 12GB worth of data that included the personal information and even credit card details of the charity's volunteers.

Example 4:

'CTI': We found Operation Earth Kitsune using a total of five C&C servers, seven samples, and four new bugs, aiming to compromise websites to host malware. We initiated our investigation after noticing that the Korean American National Coordinating Council (KANCC) website was redirecting visitors to the Hanseattle website. Users who accessed the said site were redirected to a weaponized version of a proof of concept (POC) for the CVE-2019-5782 Google Chrome vulnerability published in the chromium tracking system. Digging deeper, we discovered that the attack does not only involve a weaponized version of the mentioned Chrome exploit; the exploit was infecting the victim machine with three separate malware samples.

Target report:

\"CTI\": BCycle, a corporation that operates bicycle sharing service, found malware on its website that allowed a hacker to find personal information of users who signed up for a membership pass through the company's website. The breached information may have included users' names, credit card numbers, and addresses. The company claimed to cover the cost of one year of identity theft protection for affected customers.

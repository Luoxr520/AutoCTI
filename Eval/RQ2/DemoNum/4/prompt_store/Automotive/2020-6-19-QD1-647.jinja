Example 1:

'CTI': A new Android backdoor has been discovered with potent capabilities to carry out a range of malicious actions on infected devices. Dubbed Xamalicious by the McAfee Mobile Research Team, the malware is so named for the fact that it's developed using an open-source mobile app framework called Xamarin and abuses the operating system's accessibility permissions to fulfill its objectives. It's also capable of gathering metadata about the compromised device and contacting a command-and-control (C2) server to fetch a second-stage payload, but only after determining if it fits the bill. The second stage is dynamically injected as an assembly DLL at runtime level to take full control of the device and potentially perform fraudulent actions such as clicking on ads, installing apps, among other actions financially motivated without user consent. The cybersecurity firm said it identified 25 apps that come with this active threat, some of which were distributed on the official Google Play Store since mid-2020. The apps are estimated to have been installed at least 327,000 times.

Example 2:

'CTI': Since mid-November 2023, Microsoft Threat Intelligence has observed threat actors, including financially motivated actors like Storm-0569, Storm-1113, Sangria Tempest, and Storm-1674, utilizing the ms-appinstaller URI scheme (App Installer) to distribute malware. In addition to ensuring that customers are protected from observed attacker activity, Microsoft investigated the use of App Installer in these attacks. In response to this activity, Microsoft has disabled the ms-appinstaller protocol handler by default. The observed threat actor activity abuses the current implementation of the ms-appinstaller protocol handler as an access vector for malware that may lead to ransomware distribution. Multiple cybercriminals are also selling a malware kit as a service that abuses the MSIX file format and ms-appinstaller protocol handler. These threat actors distribute signed malicious MSIX application packages using websites accessed through malicious advertisements for legitimate popular software. A second vector of phishing through Microsoft Teams is also in use by Storm-1674.

Example 3:

'CTI': We discovered a recent WhatsApp phishing campaign through our telemetry that led to banking trojan activity. In this campaign, the attacker shares a malicious APK file through WhatsApp with a message asking users to enter sensitive information in the app. The widely circulated fake banking message states \u201cYour [redacted] BANK Account will be Blocked Today please update your PANCARD immediately open [redacted]-Bank.apk for update your PANCARD. Thank You.\u201d and includes a APK file named [redacted]-BANK[.]apk. Upon investigation, we discovered that the APK file was malicious and interacting with it installs a fraudulent application on the victim device. The installed app impersonates a legitimate bank located in India and disguises itself as the bank's official Know Your Customer (KYC) application to trick users into submitting their sensitive information, despite this particular banking organization not being affiliated with an official KYC-related app. This information is then sent to a command and control (C2) server, as well as to the attacker's hard-coded phone number used in SMS functionality.

Example 4:

'CTI': Graphican is an evolution of the known Flea backdoor Ketrican, which itself was based on a previous malware \u2014 BS2005 \u2014 also used by Flea. Graphican has the same basic functionality as Ketrican, with the difference between them being Graphican's use of the Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive to obtain its command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure. This technique was used in a similar way by the Russian state-sponsored APT group Swallowtail (aka APT28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Strontium) in a campaign in 2022 in which it delivered the Graphite malware. In that campaign, the Graphite malware used the Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive as a C&C server. The observed Graphican samples did not have a hardcoded C&C server, rather they connected to OneDrive via the Microsoft Graph API to get the encrypted C&C server address from a child folder inside the Person folder. The malware then decoded the folder name and used it as a C&C server for the malware. All instances of this variant used the same parameters to authenticate to the Microsoft Graph API.

Target report:

\"CTI\": To get accurate notifications on his vehicle charging status, a hacker reversed engineered BMW's connected drive and created an open-sourced app that actively retrieves real-time charging information from his vehicle using BMW's API. To use the app, users must configure their credentials to authenticate with BMW's API. With some additional development, the app could also allow control of BMW's other connected API features - activation of headlights, horns, and unlock/lock commands through the open sourced app.

Example 1:

'CTI': Security researchers have spotted a recent increase in attacks involving a sophisticated new variant of Jupyter, an information stealer that has been targeting users of Chrome, Edge, and Firefox browsers since at least 2020. The malware, also referred to as Yellow Cockatoo, Solarmarker, and Polazert, can backdoor machines and harvest a variety of credential information, including computer name, the user's admin privileges, cookies, Web data, browser password manager information, and other sensitive data from victim systems - such as logins for crypto-wallets and remote access apps. Researchers from VMware's Carbon Black managed detection and response (MDR) service recently observed the new version of the malware leveraging PowerShell command modifications and legitimate-looking, digitally signed payloads, infecting a steadily rising number of systems since late October. Morphisec and BlackBerry \u2014 two other vendors that have previously tracked Jupyter \u2014 have identified the malware as capable of functioning as a full-fledged backdoor. They have described its capabilities as including support for command and control (C2) communications, acting as a dropper and loader for other malware, hollowing shell code to evade detection, and executing PowerShell scripts and commands. BlackBerry has reported observing Jupyter also targeting crypto-wallets, such as Ethereum Wallet, MyMonero Wallet, and Atomic Wallet, in addition to accessing OpenVPN, Remote Desktop Protocol, and other remote access applications.

Example 2:

'CTI': Vulnerable Microsoft SQL servers are currently being targeted by threat actors and infected with FARGO ransomware (also known as Mallox and TargetCompany). Microsoft's SQL servers hold data for internet services and apps. A disruption  to these databases by FARGO could cause severe issues for businesses. In February 2022, the threat actors behind FARGO attacks dropped Cobalt Strike beacons, and by July 2022, they were hijacking vulnerable Microsoft SQL servers to steal bandwidth for their own proxy services. The latest FARGO attacks blackmail database owners into paying the demanded ransom. If the owners refuse to pay the ransom, the threat actors threaten to expose their stolen files on Telegram. FARGO is one of the most popular ransomware strains that focuses on Microsoft SQL servers. The ransomware infection starts by using powershell.exe and cmd.exe to download a .NET file to a compromised machine. After the payload fetches additional malware, a .BAT file terminates certain processes and services. To ensure that businesses can't recover their data, FARGO executes the recovery deactivation command and kills processes prior to initiating encryption. Once encryption is complete, FARGO renames locked files using the '.Fargo3' extension and generates a ransom note titled 'RECOVERY FILES.txt'. The threat actors expect the demanded ransom to be paid in Bitcoin. Database servers are often compromised via brute-force, and if a threat actor is able to use brute-force in their attack, it's likely due to their target having weak credentials. The threat actor may also try to attack a database server by exploiting well-known and unpatched vulnerabilities. It's important that organizations keep their devices updated with the latest security patches and maintain strong passwords.

Example 3:

'CTI': Unit 42 researchers have investigated a series of destructive cyberattacks beginning in January 2023 and continuing as recently as October 2023, targeting the education and technology sectors in Israel. The attacks are characterized by attempts to steal sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) and intellectual property. Once the attackers stole the information, they deployed various wipers intended to cover the attackers' tracks and to render the infected endpoints unusable.

Example 4:

'CTI': We discovered a recent WhatsApp phishing campaign through our telemetry that led to banking trojan activity. In this campaign, the attacker shares a malicious APK file through WhatsApp with a message asking users to enter sensitive information in the app. The widely circulated fake banking message states \u201cYour [redacted] BANK Account will be Blocked Today please update your PANCARD immediately open [redacted]-Bank.apk for update your PANCARD. Thank You.\u201d and includes a APK file named [redacted]-BANK[.]apk. Upon investigation, we discovered that the APK file was malicious and interacting with it installs a fraudulent application on the victim device. The installed app impersonates a legitimate bank located in India and disguises itself as the bank's official Know Your Customer (KYC) application to trick users into submitting their sensitive information, despite this particular banking organization not being affiliated with an official KYC-related app. This information is then sent to a command and control (C2) server, as well as to the attacker's hard-coded phone number used in SMS functionality.

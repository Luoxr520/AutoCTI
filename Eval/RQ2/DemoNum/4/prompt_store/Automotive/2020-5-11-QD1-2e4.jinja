Example 1:

'CTI': As part of TAG's mission to counter serious threats to Google and our users, we've analyzed a range of persistent threats including APT35 and Charming Kitten, an Iranian government-backed group that regularly targets high risk users. For years, we have been countering this group\u2019s efforts to hijack accounts, deploy malware, and their use of novel techniques to conduct espionage aligned with the interests of the Iranian government. Now, we\u2019re shining light on a new tool of theirs. In December 2021, TAG discovered a novel Charming Kitten tool, named HYPERSCRAPE, used to steal user data from Gmail, Yahoo!, and Microsoft Outlook accounts. The attacker runs HYPERSCRAPE on their own machine to download victims\u2019 inboxes using previously acquired credentials. We have seen it deployed against fewer than two dozen accounts located in Iran. The oldest known sample is from 2020, and the tool is still under active development. We have taken actions to re-secure these accounts and have notified the victims through our Government Backed Attacker Warnings.

Example 2:

'CTI': Crysis/Dharma ransomware (detected by Trend Micro as Ransom.Win32.CRYSIS.TIBGGS) has released a hacking toolkit named Toolbox, Sophos reports. Toolbox contains Mimikatz to harvest passwords, NirSoft Remote Desktop PassView to steal remote desktop protocol (RDP) passwords, Hash Suite Tools Free to dump hashes, and other tools to help find target computers and deploy the ransomware payload. With this kit, even rookie hackers can infiltrate networks easily. Crysis operates under a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, and this hacking tool only makes it easier for affiliates to spread the ransomware to more targets.

Example 3:

'CTI': SilverRAT shows that the region's cybercriminal groups are becoming more sophisticated, according to Cyfirma's analysis. The first version of SilverRAT, whose source code was leaked by unknown actors in October, consists of a builder that allows the user to construct a remote access Trojan with specific features. The more interesting features, according to Cyfirma's analysis, include using either an IP address or webpage for command and control, bypasses for antivirus software, the ability to erase system restore points, and the delayed execution of payloads. At least two threat actors \u2014 one using the handle \"Dangerous silver\" and a second using \"Monstermc\" \u2014 are the developers behind both SilverRAT and a previous program, S500 RAT, according to Cyfirma's analysis. The hackers operate on Telegram and through online forums where they sell malware-as-a-service, distribute cracked RATs from other developers, and offer a variety of other services. In addition, they have a blog and website called Anonymous Arabic.

Example 4:

'CTI': Since at least August, attackers have been exploiting CVE-2023-4966 (aka CitrixBleed), a 7.5 high-severity vulnerability affecting Citrix Systems' NetScaler ADC and Gateway networking products. Even after it was brought to light in October, many organizations have struggled to comprehensively shore up their systems. One such organization appears to be Comcast Xfinity. On Monday, the cable giant disclosed a CitrixBleed-enabled breach of its customer data, including usernames and hashed passwords, and, for some, names, contact information, last four digits of Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and security questions and answers.

Target report:

\"CTI\": 2 years after hacking Indian car-rental platform, Zoomcar, the hackers publicly offered the information of 3.5 million app users for sale on the dark web. The hackers waited two years before making the offer public to avoid being caught by officials tracking their IP addresses. For $300, one can buy the usernames, passwords, emails, phone numbers, and IP addresses and potentially use the information to hack accounts on other platforms.

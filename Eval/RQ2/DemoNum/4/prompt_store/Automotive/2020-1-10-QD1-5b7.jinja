Example 1:

'CTI': Since mid-November 2023, Microsoft Threat Intelligence has observed threat actors, including financially motivated actors like Storm-0569, Storm-1113, Sangria Tempest, and Storm-1674, utilizing the ms-appinstaller URI scheme (App Installer) to distribute malware. In addition to ensuring that customers are protected from observed attacker activity, Microsoft investigated the use of App Installer in these attacks. In response to this activity, Microsoft has disabled the ms-appinstaller protocol handler by default. The observed threat actor activity abuses the current implementation of the ms-appinstaller protocol handler as an access vector for malware that may lead to ransomware distribution. Multiple cybercriminals are also selling a malware kit as a service that abuses the MSIX file format and ms-appinstaller protocol handler. These threat actors distribute signed malicious MSIX application packages using websites accessed through malicious advertisements for legitimate popular software. A second vector of phishing through Microsoft Teams is also in use by Storm-1674.

Example 2:

'CTI': PurpleFox (or 'DirtyMoe') is a modular Windows botnet malware first spotted in 2018 that comes with a rootkit module allowing it to hide and persist between device reboots. It can be used as a downloader that introduces more potent second-stage payloads on compromised systems, offers its operators backdoor capabilities, and can also act as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) bot. In October 2021, researchers noticed that new versions of PurpleFox switched to using WebSocket for command and control (C2) communications for stealth. In January 2022, a campaign spread the malware under the guise of a Telegram desktop app. CERT-UA used IoCs shared by Avast and TrendMicro to identify PurpleFox malware infections on Ukrainian computers, tracking the activity under the identifier 'UAC-0027'. CERT-UA says PurpleFox typically infects systems when victims launch laced MSI installers and highlights its self-propagation capabilities using exploits for known flaws and password brute-forcing.

Example 3:

'CTI': We discovered a recent WhatsApp phishing campaign through our telemetry that led to banking trojan activity. In this campaign, the attacker shares a malicious APK file through WhatsApp with a message asking users to enter sensitive information in the app. The widely circulated fake banking message states \u201cYour [redacted] BANK Account will be Blocked Today please update your PANCARD immediately open [redacted]-Bank.apk for update your PANCARD. Thank You.\u201d and includes a APK file named [redacted]-BANK[.]apk. Upon investigation, we discovered that the APK file was malicious and interacting with it installs a fraudulent application on the victim device. The installed app impersonates a legitimate bank located in India and disguises itself as the bank's official Know Your Customer (KYC) application to trick users into submitting their sensitive information, despite this particular banking organization not being affiliated with an official KYC-related app. This information is then sent to a command and control (C2) server, as well as to the attacker's hard-coded phone number used in SMS functionality.

Example 4:

'CTI': A new Android backdoor has been discovered with potent capabilities to carry out a range of malicious actions on infected devices. Dubbed Xamalicious by the McAfee Mobile Research Team, the malware is so named for the fact that it's developed using an open-source mobile app framework called Xamarin and abuses the operating system's accessibility permissions to fulfill its objectives. It's also capable of gathering metadata about the compromised device and contacting a command-and-control (C2) server to fetch a second-stage payload, but only after determining if it fits the bill. The second stage is dynamically injected as an assembly DLL at runtime level to take full control of the device and potentially perform fraudulent actions such as clicking on ads, installing apps, among other actions financially motivated without user consent. The cybersecurity firm said it identified 25 apps that come with this active threat, some of which were distributed on the official Google Play Store since mid-2020. The apps are estimated to have been installed at least 327,000 times.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Developers used Tesla\u2019s mobile app API to create a private monitor and control adaptation for desktops. The open sourced app communicates with Tesla servers and can perform main Tesla mobile app capabilities. The app can track the location and statuses of the vehicle, take remote control of the vehicle\u2019s temperature, and control it's locks. The app can also turn on/off the Sentry mode feature - a Tesla feature allowing the recording of record suspicious activities around a parked vehicle.

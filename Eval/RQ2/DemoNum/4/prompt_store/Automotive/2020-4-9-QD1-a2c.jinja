Example 1:

'CTI': After emerging in January 2022, Royal ransomware is a ransomware strain that is being distributed by ransomware threat actors from previous operations. Initially, Microsoft attributed the distribution of Royal ransomware to DEV-0569 - a temporary name given by the tech company. Now, researchers are stating that the threat actors behind Royal ransomware have officially branded themselves with the name Royal (the name left behind in recent ransomware notes) and they are primarily focused on targeting entities within the U.S. The ransomware operation uses unusual techniques to breach networks before encrypting them with malware and demanding ransom payments. Some Royal ransomware campaigns distribute the malware via malicious attachments, and some distribute the malware via malicious advertisements. Although Royal is a newer ransomware operation, researchers believe the threat actors behind it are very experienced due to evidence of previously seen tactics and techniques. In September 2022, the operators behind Royal ransomware began ramping up their malicious activities. They were observed by our technology partner, AdvIntel, utilizing other ransomware operation's encryptors, such as BlackCat. By November 2022, Royal took responsibility for a ransomware attack on one of the United Kingdom's most popular racing circuits - Silverstone Circuit. The attack held up dozens of Formula One races and motorcycle events. Details regarding the attack were not disclosed, but Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow stated that because Royal's ransomware is secure, its encryption cannot be broken. Callow also stated that unlike current ransomware groups, Royal uses multiple ransomware types and uses the .Royal extension for encrypted files rather than using randomly generated extensions.

Example 2:

'CTI': A new ransomware family calling itself 3AM has emerged. To date, the ransomware has only been used in a limited fashion. Symantec's Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, has seen it used in a single attack by a ransomware affiliate that attempted to deploy LockBit on a target's network and then switched to 3AM when LockBit was blocked. 3AM is written in Rust and appears to be a completely new malware family. The ransomware attempts to stop multiple services on the infected computer before it begins encrypting files. Once encryption is complete, it attempts to delete Volume Shadow (VSS) copies. It is still unclear whether its authors have any links to known cybercrime organizations.

Example 3:

'CTI': Threat actors are using public exploits to pummel a critical zero-day remote code execution (RCE) flaw that affects all versions of a popular collaboration tool used in cloud and hybrid server environments and allows for complete host takeover.Researchers from Volexity uncovered the flaw in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center software over the Memorial Day weekend after they detected suspicious activity on two internet-facing web servers belonging to a customer running the software, they said in a blog post published last week. The researchers tracked the activity to a public exploit for the vulnerability, CVE-2022-26134, that\u2019s been spreading rapidly, and subsequently reported the flaw to Atlassian. As observed by Volexity researchers, what\u2019s being described as an \u201cOGNL injection vulnerability\u201d appears to allow for a Java Server Page (JSP) webshell to be written into a publicly accessible web directory on Confluence software.

Example 4:

'CTI': More than 3,000 Internet-accessible Apache ActiveMQ Servers are exposed to a critical remote code execution vulnerability that an attacker has begun actively targeting to drop ransomware. The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) disclosed the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-46604, on Oct. 27. The bug allows a remote attacker with access to an ActiveMQ message broker to execute arbitrary commands on affected systems. Proof-of-concept exploit code and full details of the vulnerability are publicly available, meaning that threat actors have both the means and the information to launch attacks against the vulnerability. Researchers at Rapid7 reported observing exploit activity targeting the flaw at two customer locations, starting the same day that ASF disclosed the threat. In both instances, the adversary attempted to deploy ransomware binaries on target systems in an effort to ransom the victim organizations. They described both targeted organizations as running outdated versions of Apache ActiveMQ. The researchers attributed the malicious activity to the HelloKitty ransomware family, based on the ransom note and other attack attributes. HelloKitty ransomware has been percolating in the wild since at least 2020. Its operators have tended to favor double-extortion attacks in which they have not just encrypted the data but also stolen it as additional leverage for extracting a ransom from victims. The HelloKitty ransomware attacks leveraging the ActiveMQ flaw appeared somewhat rudimentary. In one of the attacks, the threat actor made more than a half dozen attempts to encrypt the data, prompting the researchers to label to threat actor as 'clumsy' in their report.

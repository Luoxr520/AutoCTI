Example 1:

'CTI': The Android banking malware known as Vultur has been updated with new capabilities, allowing operators to interact with the infected devices and modify files, according to a report from security consulting outfit NCC Group. Vultur was first documented in March 2021, when it stood out for the abuse of the legitimate applications AlphaVNC and ngrok for remotely accessing the VNC server on the victim device, and for automating screen recording and key-logging for credential harvesting. The most recent version of the banking malware, however, packs significantly more capabilities, allowing attackers to control the infected device, prevent applications from running, display custom notifications, bypass lock-screen protections, and download, upload, install, search for, and delete files. The infection chain starts with a SMS message instructing the victim to call a phone number to resolve a large transaction that they did not authorize. During the call, a second SMS message that includes a link to a modified McAfee Security package is received. The modified application contains the functionality of the legitimate McAfee Security software, along with the dropper-framework called Brunhilda, which deploys Vultur via three payloads, the last two designed to invoke each other\u2019s functionality. \u201cThe message sent by the malware operator through FCM can contain a command, which, upon receipt, triggers the execution of corresponding functionality within the malware. This eliminates the need for an ongoing connection with the device,\u201d NCC Group explains. The latest version of Vultur can also prevent the user from interacting with applications on the device, which are defined in a list provided by the attacker.

Example 2:

'CTI': RansomExx is a ransomware variant that debuted as Defray777 in 2018. It made a name for itself in 2020, after it was used in widely reported attacks on government agencies, manufacturers, and other such high-profile only months apart. By then, it was dubbed RansomEXX after the string \u201cransom.exx\u201d was found in its binary. In 2020, the group also started a leak site for publishing stolen data.Today, RansomEXX remains an active name among other ransomware variants like LockBit and Conti. Like other groups, the one running RansomEXX appears to have no qualms about publishing data stolen from its targets. It has also published information stolen from government agencies \u2014 a recent case was an attack on a Scottish mental health charity in March 2022, where they published 12GB worth of data that included the personal information and even credit card details of the charity's volunteers.

Example 3:

'CTI': Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service hackers, which we call Cloaked Ursa (aka APT29, UAC-0004, Midnight Blizzard/Nobelium, Cozy Bear) are well known for targeting diplomatic missions globally. Their initial access attempts over the past two years have predominantly used phishing lures with a theme of diplomatic operations such as the following:
1. Notes verbale (semiformal government-to-government diplomatic communications)
2. Embassies' operating status updates
3. Schedules for diplomats
4. Invitations to embassy events. These types of lures are generally sent to individuals who handle this type of embassy correspondence as part of their daily jobs. They are meant to entice targets to open the files on behalf of the organization they work for. Recently, Unit 42 researchers observed instances of Cloaked Ursa using lures focusing on the diplomats themselves more than the countries they represent. We have identified Cloaked Ursa targeting diplomatic missions within Ukraine by leveraging something that all recently placed diplomats need \u2013 a vehicle. We observed Cloaked Ursa targeting at least 22 of over 80 foreign missions located in Kyiv. While we don't have details on their infection success rate, this is a truly astonishing number for a clandestine operation conducted by an advanced persistent threat (APT) that the United States and the United Kingdom publicly attribute to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).

Example 4:

'CTI': Attackers can exploit a critical Bluetooth security vulnerability that's been lurking largely unnoticed for years on macOS, iOS, Android, and Linux device platforms. The keystroke injection vulnerability allows an attacker to control the targeted device as if they were attached by a Bluetooth keyboard, performing various functions remotely depending on the endpoint. Tracked as CVE-2023-45866, the flaw exists in how in the Bluetooth protocol is implemented on various platforms. It works by tricking the Bluetooth host state-machine into pairing with a fake keyboard without user confirmation. The vulnerability enables an attacker to pair an emulated Bluetooth keyboard with a victim's phone or computer, implementing the keyboard as a Python script that runs on a Linux computer. The attacker can then inject keystrokes, typing on the target device as if they were a Bluetooth keyboard legitimately attached to the target.

Target report:

\"CTI\": In an attempt to mimic a Heads Up Display (HUD) on a C6 Corvette, a hacker built a custom HUD that showed the vehicle\u2019s speed and RPM on a transparent display mounted on a dashboard. The hacker collected the RPM and the speed of the vehicle with a Bluetooth OBD-II reader and then transferred the details to a development board that recorded the vehicle data to a SD card and another MCU that ran the actual LED displayed in the HUD.

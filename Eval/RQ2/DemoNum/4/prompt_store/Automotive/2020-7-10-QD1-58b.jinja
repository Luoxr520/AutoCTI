Example 1:

'CTI': A new Android backdoor has been discovered with potent capabilities to carry out a range of malicious actions on infected devices. Dubbed Xamalicious by the McAfee Mobile Research Team, the malware is so named for the fact that it's developed using an open-source mobile app framework called Xamarin and abuses the operating system's accessibility permissions to fulfill its objectives. It's also capable of gathering metadata about the compromised device and contacting a command-and-control (C2) server to fetch a second-stage payload, but only after determining if it fits the bill. The second stage is dynamically injected as an assembly DLL at runtime level to take full control of the device and potentially perform fraudulent actions such as clicking on ads, installing apps, among other actions financially motivated without user consent. The cybersecurity firm said it identified 25 apps that come with this active threat, some of which were distributed on the official Google Play Store since mid-2020. The apps are estimated to have been installed at least 327,000 times.

Example 2:

'CTI': The recent iOS 14.8 update fixes a zero-day, zero-click exploit for a vulnerability affecting every mobile iOS device. The flaw, dubbed FORCEDENTRY (CVE-2021-30860), resided in Apple's iMessage and, according to a report by The Citizen Lab, was used to push NSO Group's Pegasus spyware to mobile iOS devices dating back to as far as February 2021. Pegasus has been around for some years now but has been back in the spotlight recently following reports from both The Citizen Lab and Amnesty International about the spyware targeting journalists, activists, and others. One of the main concerns with FORCEDENTRY is that it can be used in what is called a zero-click attack, meaning it requires no user interaction. An attacker exploiting the flaw only needs the Apple ID of a device in order to silently compromise it

Example 3:

'CTI': The most severe of the externally reported flaws is a use-after-free bug in ANGLE, the open source cross-platform graphics engine used in Chrome and other popular browsers. The issue is tracked as CVE-2024-2883 and Google notes in its advisory that the researcher who discovered the bug has received a $10,000 bug bounty reward. According to the advisory, the three other defects reported by external researchers are all high-severity vulnerabilities. The first is CVE-2024-2885, a use-after-free issue in Dawn. The remaining two flaws, tracked as CVE-2024-2886 and CVE-2024-2887, are zero-day vulnerabilities that were exploited and reported last week at the Pwn2Own Vancouver 2024 hacking contest. No additional bounty rewards, aside from those earned at the competition, were handed out for these issues. CVE-2024-2886, a use-after-free in WebCodecs, was demonstrated by Seunghyun Lee of KAIST Hacking Lab, who exploited two such issues in the browser at the hacking contest and earned a total of $145,000 in rewards. CVE-2024-2887 is a Type Confusion bug in WebAssembly, exploited on the first day of Pwn2Own by security researcher Manfred Paul, who earned a $42,500 reward for it.Paul also demonstrated Safari and Firefox vulnerabilities at the hacking contest, earning a total of over $200,000 in rewards and winning the competition. Mozilla was first to release patches for the zero-day demonstrated at Pwn2Own.

Example 4:

'CTI': Attackers are exploiting a 6-year-old Microsoft Office remote code execution (RCE) flaw to deliver spyware, in an email campaign weaponized by malicious Excel attachments and characterized by sophisticated evasion tactics. Threat actors dangle lures relating to business activity in spam emails that deliver files that contain CVE-2017-11882, an RCE flaw that dates back to 2014 and can allow for system takeover, Zscaler revealed in a blog post published Dec. 19. The end goal of the attack is to load Agent Tesla, a remote access Trojan (RAT) and advanced keylogger first discovered in 2014, and exfiltrate credentials and other data from an infected system via a Telegram bot run by the attackers.

Target report:

\"CTI\": A researcher created a mobile phone sized attack device that jams the Collision Avoidance System (CAS) in autonomous vehicles from a relatively short distance. He was able to cause an accident by making the forward collision warning (FCW) and autonomous emergency braking (AEB) less sensitive and slow to respond. He demonstrated the attack on a Tesla Model 3 and Lynk&Co 01 and provided tools to assist other researchers to find the vehicle's collision avoidance system radar parameter, facilitating future attacks on autonomous vehicles.

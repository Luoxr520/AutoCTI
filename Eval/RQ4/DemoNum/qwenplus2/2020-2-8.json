In order to issue commands, the open source app simply requires configuring Fordpass credentials and VIN. Then, the open source app sends HTTP requests directly to Fordpass\u2019s API. Users of the open source app can retrieve the vehicle status information, start and stop the engine, and issue lock/unlock commands to the vehicle. Deploying the custom app on cloud platforms enables the users to create a shortcut on their mobile and even issue voice commands to the vehicle using SIRI.",

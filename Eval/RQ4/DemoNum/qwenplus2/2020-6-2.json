He found the credentials to the system in a public Github repository. Though logging into the system from its standard user interface requires multi-factor authentication, the researcher proved he was able to bypass it by crafting requests directly to the IT service API. A motivated attacker could use this access to view help desk tickets that were issued, and map Tesla\u2019s internal servers, IP addresses, and issues reported to Tesla\u2019s system administors.",

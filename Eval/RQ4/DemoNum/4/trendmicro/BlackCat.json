        "text": "First observed in mid-November 2021 by researchers from the MalwareHunterTeam, BlackCat (aka AlphaVM, AlphaV, or ALPHV) swiftly gained notoriety for being the first major professional ransomware family to be written in Rust, a cross-platform language that enables malicious actors to customize malware with ease for different operating systems like Windows and Linux, thus affording a wide range of enterprise environments. Since then, BlackCat ransomware has frequently made the headlines for its successive attacks on high-profile targets and its use of triple extortion which has endowed the group with a distinct competitive edge over other RaaS operators. Aside from exposing exfiltrated data, ransomware actors that use triple extortion threaten to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on their victims' infrastructure to coerce them to pay the ransom.",

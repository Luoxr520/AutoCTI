        "text": "Cisco released a security advisory on Sept. 6, 2023, stating that Akira ransomware operators exploited CVE-2023-20269, a zero-day vulnerability in two of their products' remote access VPN feature: the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) software and Cisco Firepower Thread Defense (FTD) software. Cisco reported that malicious actors who exploit CVE-2023-20269 can identify valid credentials that could be abused to establish unauthorized remote access VPN sessions, and for victims running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16 or earlier, establish a clientless SSL VPN session. Recently, Sentinel One released a video analyzing an Akira ransomware variant named Megazord that emerged in August 2023. This variant appears to be referencing a Power Rangers formation because it encrypts files with the \u201cPOWERRANGES\u201d file extension. The ransom note, which is named \u201cpowerranges.txt,\u201d instructs victims to contact the ransomware actor via TOX messenger.",

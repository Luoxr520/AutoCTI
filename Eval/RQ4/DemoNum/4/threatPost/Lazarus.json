        "text": "North Korean APT Lazarus is up to its old tricks with a cyberespionage campaign targeting engineers with a fake job posting that attempt to spread macOS malware. The malicious Mac executable used in the campaign targets both Apple and Intel chip-based systems. The campaign, identified by researchers from ESET Research Labs and revealed in a series of tweets posted Tuesday, impersonates cryptocurrency trader Coinbase in a job description claiming to seek an engineering manager for product security, researchers divulged. Dubbed Operation Interception, the recent campaign drops a signed Mac executable disguised as a job description for Coinbase, which researchers discovered uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil. Malware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon. It drops three files: a decoy PDF document Coinbase_online_careers_2022_07.pdf, a bundle http[://]FinderFontsUpdater[.]app and a downloader safarifontagent.\u201d",

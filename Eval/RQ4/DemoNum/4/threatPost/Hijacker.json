        "text": "ChromeLoader may seem on the surface like a run-of-the-mill browser hijacker that merely redirects victims to advertisement websites. However, its use of PowerShell could pose a greater risk by leading to further and advanced malicious activity, such as the propagation of ransomware or spyware or theft of browser-session data. Researchers are warning of the potential for ChromeLoader-which has seen a resurgence in activity recently-to pose a more sophisticated threat than typical malvertisers do, according to two separate blog posts by Malwarebytes Labs and Red Canary. ChromeLoader is a pervasive and persistent browser hijacker that eventually manifests as a browser extension, modifying victims\u2019 Chrome settings and redirecting user traffic to advertisement websites. On Windows machines, victims become infected with the malware through ISO files that poses as a cracked video game or pirated films or TV programs.",

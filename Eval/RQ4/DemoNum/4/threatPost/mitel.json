The critical remote code execution (RCE) flaw, tracked as CVE-2022-29499, was first report by Crowdstrike in April as a zero-day vulnerability and is now patched. Mitel is popularly known for providing business phone systems and unified communication as a service (UCaaS) to all forms of organizations.

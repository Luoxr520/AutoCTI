        "text": "A Canadian company hacked Tesla\u2019s software, and it is now offering some of its Tesla software performance upgrades at a discount. The company offers an easily pluggable connector that cracks Tesla's 'acceleration boost' which unlocks roughly 50 hp in the Model 3 powertrain and shortens the acceleration. The company also added an additional \u201cdrift mode\u201d capability to those who purchase the \u201cacceleration boost\u201d package. The company also offers to upgrade Model 3 Dual Motor vehicles to a Model 3 Performance, however, this service is more invasive, requires professional hardware installation, and will disable the capability to receive software updates from Tesla.",

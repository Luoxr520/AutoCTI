        "text": "Researchers performed a comprehensive security analysis of 77 wireless OBD-II dongles available on Amazon in the US in 2019. The results identified 5 different types of vulnerabilities, 4 of which were newly discovered. Each of the 77 dongles had at least two types of vulnerabilities indicating a widespread vulnerability exposure among wireless OBD-II dongles on the market today. Nearly all dongles had no default connection layer authentication, allowing a potential attacker access to the CAN bus in the broadcast stage. Most dongles didn\u2019t filter out undefined CAN messages, making them vulnerable to undefined malicious CAN injections. Some of the dongles allowed multiple connections at once, allowing an attack against the vehicle even with the owner\u2019s mobile device connected. Additionally, the researchers managed to successfully install malicious over-the-air firmware upgrades to three dongles lacking FOTA authentication mechanisms.",

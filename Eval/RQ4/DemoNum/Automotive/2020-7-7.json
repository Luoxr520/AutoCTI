In the video, one of the thieves stood near the front door of the house and pulled out a device to capture the signal being emitted from the keyless fob, which was located near the inside entrance of the house. The boosted signal unlocked the car and also started the vehicle\u2019s engine, allowing the thieves to flee with the vehicle.",

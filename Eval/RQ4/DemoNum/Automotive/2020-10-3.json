They successfully disrupted vehicle charging with a spoofing device developed in a laboratory using low-cost hardware and software. The researchers performed three manipulations using a \u201cman in the middle\" (MITM) device that spoofed signals between the charger and vehicle. They were able to limit the vehicle's rate of charging, block the battery charging, and overcharged the vehicle.",

He was able to cause an accident by making the forward collision warning (FCW) and autonomous emergency braking (AEB) less sensitive and slow to respond. He demonstrated the attack on a Tesla Model 3 and Lynk&Co 01 and provided tools to assist other researchers to find the vehicle's collision avoidance system radar parameter, facilitating future attacks on autonomous vehicles.",

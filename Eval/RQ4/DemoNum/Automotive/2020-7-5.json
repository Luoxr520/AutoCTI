The company\u2019s SOS Key Tool is marketed as \u2018the most advanced locksmith tool\u2019 available. It is currently sold for \u00a320,000, and unlike other popular devices, it doesn't require a relay from a nearby key fob to unlock vehicles. The gadget records the car\u2019s data and acts as a responder which the vehicle recognizes as an authorized remote. The car will unlock and start as if the thief had a valid key fob. A tutorial video on YouTube shows how it can be used to unlock modern Kia, Hyundai, and Mitsubishi models within a minute.",

The researcher was able to edit the metadata related to the recordings including the date of the recording and its location and replace the MP4 video recordings. As dashcam recordings are used in insurance claims as evidence for acts of theft, vandalism, or accidents, this vulnerability can cost a lot to insurers. People can use this hack to replace the video and metadata of a dashcam recording with a similar vehicle that had a crash to get entitled for free repair if they have third party insurance.",

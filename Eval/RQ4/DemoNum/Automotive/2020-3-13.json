Once an attacker obtains the frequency of the key fob and captures the \u201copen door\u201d transmission sent from the fob, they can re-use the \u201copen door\u201d signal in a replay attack as the RF signal sent by the fob doesn't vary. Other car models made by the OEM may have the same keyless system and therefore be prone to replay attacks.",

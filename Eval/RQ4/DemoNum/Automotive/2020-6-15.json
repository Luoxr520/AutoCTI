        "text": "A hacker demonstrated how Nissan Leaf owners could pair newly installed batteries while avoiding the 'invalid battery' trouble code that reduces the vehicle's performance. In order to clear the trouble code, the vehicle control module ECU had to acknowledge the new battery ID. The hacker demonstrated two methods to do it: The first method is to replace the LBC (Lithium Battery Control) ECU into the new battery. The second method is initiating a MITM attack through the vehicle's CAN-bus. By spoofing the ID of the previous battery on the messages sent by the newly installed one, the ID on the CAN-Bus will match the one stored in the VCM ECU and will allow the vehicle to operate as if the new battery was programmed by the OEM.",

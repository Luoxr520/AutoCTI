The vulnerability causes the program execution to continue with corrupted runtime state and allows exploitation after gaining access to the vehicle\u2019s Wi-Fi network. Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution on the vehicle.",
